# Artist Date Practice

The idea for the artist date comes from the book 'The Artists Way' by Julia Cameron. 
This is an adoptin of the idea for an exploration of coding.

The artists date, is setting aside some time each week to nourish the inner artist, do something festive, to explore something that interests you, to play. The aspect of playing is very interesting as it is nourashing and cultivating artistic capabilities. 

In this repository I record my weekly artist date projects, where I spend about an hour or so building something just to explore and play with tools and technology. This is about cultivating the artistic muscules of play and creativity. 

"The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves". - C. G. Jung
