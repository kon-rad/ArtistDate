# Artist Date Practice

> "The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves."

C. G. Jung

The idea for the artist date comes from the book 'The Artists Way' by Julia Cameron. 
This is an adoption of the original idea to the exploration of coding. Each week I create something just for the joy of creating.

The artists date, is setting aside some time each week to nourish the inner artist; do something festive, to explore something that interests you, to play. When choosing an artist date, ask yourself 'what sounds fun' and then try it. Examples are: going to a sanctuary and spending some time there, drawing under a tree in the park, visiting an art's supply store. The act of playing and spending time with your inner artist is nourshing to the deeper soul within and cultivates artistic capabilities. 

In this repository I record my weekly artist date projects, where I spend about an hour or so building something just to explore and play with tools and technology. This is about cultivating the artistic muscles of play and creativity.
